You are the new Slimeherd. The chosen one to reunite all types of slimes to re-forme the king slime!

Slimes are small creatures that live peacefully together. They tend to move in group and follow their neighbors (do you know boids???). However, they need to be grouped to form the special King Slime.

Guide them inside the fence by using your natural Slimeherd influence on slime. If that not enough, you have three capacities to help you in your task.

Beware, slimes behaviors vary depend on their species.

Blue ones are excited but frightened by dog and other species.
Red ones are slow moving slime and are likely to be distracted by dog.
Green ones are the more disciplined and follow the guide.
